As a doctor's office manager, I want to use a Doctor-system program to manage my patient records, drug prescriptions, and doctor information. I need to be able to create and manage patient records, including patient name, birthdate, and identification number, as well as add and modify prescriptions associated with each patient. I also need to be able to add and manage doctor information, including doctor name, identification number, and specialist control ID where applicable. Additionally, I need to be able to view and modify information about various drugs, including drug name, identification number, price, and active ingredients. The Doctor-system program should also allow me to track prescription usage, including remaining reits, and provide me with various forms of statistics, such as the number of prescriptions per doctor or per patient, and the total cost of prescriptions. Finally, I need the ability to export all data to a file for backup and sharing purposes. The Doctor-system program should be intuitive and easy to use, and provide me with a clear and organized way to manage all aspects of my doctor's office.
